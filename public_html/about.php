<h2>About Us</h2>

<br>

<p id="para">
While there are a large number of individuals and organizations working for the cause of women’s empowerment, many struggle to find support in terms of finance as well as the right kind of human resources. On the other hand, there are also many individuals and companies that are willing to provide their time and support to these causes/projects. A platform which connects these two sets of people can encourage many initiatives for gender equality, which would otherwise not be able to get off the ground. An online platform may be developed to facilitate this interaction, while maintaining a level of security for the users. The operations and maintenance of the platform may be given to an in-house or outsourced team. General problem statement: i) At present, private platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdera and Freelancer help connect projects to financial and human resources ii) There is no platform catering to both profit and non-profit ventures specifically for women empowerment iii) There is also no platform which allows exchange of skills as well finances in one place iv) A government-run C2C crowd-sourcing platform will fill this gap and allow individuals and organizations looking for funding and other support to connect with others who can provide this support to them. System users: i) The individuals or organizations that are seeking support ii) The individuals or organizations that want to offer support iii) Administrators to verify and monitor transaction of funds and services Technology that can address this issue partially: i) An online portal which allows registration of users through automated KYC verification followed by a level of offline verification by a team. ii) The creative use of technology should be explored to create the best possible protection against fraud, fake identities, money laundering etc. iii) The portal should have the option of a payment gateway so people may choose to pay directly iv) The system should create profiles for different types of users while also allowing both public and private interactions between them v) There should be a system of public reviews and ratings for all types of users Desired Outcome: i) An online portal where users can post about their projects and requirements, which can be met by users offering their services and support ii) A system of automatic verification to help avoid fraud iii) An online payment gateway to allow direct transfer of funds between users iv) A method for administrators to block profiles of users in case of fraud or inappropriate content v) The platform will be focused on projects for the cause of women’s empowerment including but not restricted to advocacy campaigns, research projects, technological solutions, art, films, social enterprises, NGO projects etc.
